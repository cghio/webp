Example iOS app to display WebP images on iPhone/iPad
=====================================================


Getting Started
===============

To run this app you need a machine with MAC OS. You also need to have Xcode
installed. Xcode is the IDE + tools for iOS development. Latest Xcode can be
downloaded from Apple's iOS Dev Center
(http://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/index.action).

We have developed and tested this app using Xcode version 4.


How to Run
==========

1. Build WebP.framework

First you need to build WebP.framework from libwebp source tar ball.
An iOS app needs to include WebP.framework to encode/decode WebP images.

To build WebP.framework, first download and untar the latest libwebp source tar
ball (libwebp-<version>.tar.gz) from http://code.google.com/p/webp/downloads/list.
Then run the iosbuild.sh script from the base directory of libwebp
(i.e. libwebp-<version>/). iosbuild.sh script is provided with this tar ball.
This will create WebP.framework under the current directory.

2. Copy WebP.framework in the same directory where this app is

ViewWebP app looks for the WebP.framework in the "../" directory. This can be changed
by updating the path of WebP.framework in Xcode. But the easiest thing to do is to
copy WebP.framework in the same directory where the ViewWebP directory is. That is, in
the same directory where this README file is.

3. Start Xcode

4. Open ViewWebP/ViewWebP.xcodeproj file in Xcode.

This will open the ViewWebP app.

5. Select preferred device

Select the device on which you want to run the app. At the top left of Xcode
IDE you can find a drop down list of available devices. If you don't have any
iOS device connected to your MAC machine then you can choose iPhone or iPad
Simulator.

6. Run the App

You can run the app by clicking the "Run" button or by selecting "Run" from the
"Product" menu.


App UI
======

If you are able to run the app successfully then you should see a table showing
list of thumbnail images and corresponding filenames.

All these thumbnail images are WebP format images.

Tap on any row of the table and now you can see the full size WebP image.



Please refer to the objective C code (especially WebPImage.m) to see how a
WebP image is decoded to a UIImage object. It's simple!!!!

Feel free to use it in your iOS app and get better compression by using
WebP image format.
